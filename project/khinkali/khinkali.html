    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <h3>Make the dough</h3>
    <p>
        Stir together flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center of 
        dry ingredients, and add 1/2 cup water and egg. Stir with a wooden spoon 
        until a shaggy dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, 
        and knead until smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Place dough in a lightly 
        oiled bowl, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside.

    <h3>Make the meat filling</h3>
    <p>
    Using a fork or your hands, stir together all meat filling ingredients in a 
    large bowl until ground meat is completely broken up and mixture is well blended.

    <p>
    Divide dough into thirds. Shape 1 dough portion into a ball, and roll out to 
    about 1/4-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface. (Keep the remaining 
    dough portions covered with plastic wrap while you work.) Using a 2 1/2-inch round 
    cutter, cut out 8 dough circles, rerolling dough scraps as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Roll each dough circle into a larger 4-inch circle. Place about 1 tablespoon 
        (about 1/2 ounce) meat filling in center of each dough circle, and pleat dough 
        edge, gathering top like a pouch to enclose filling. When you have pleated all 
        the way around, pinch top edges together firmly, and give the dough a little 
        twist to make a stem and to make sure the khinkali is well sealed. 
        (If you don’t want the stems, lightly press the twisted stem down into the 
        dumpling with your finger.) Place finished dumplings on a piece of lightly 
        floured parchment paper; cover loosely with plastic wrap, and repeat process 
        with remaining dough portions and fillin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring a large pot of salted water and bay leaves to a boil over high. 
        Carefully add half of dumplings to water, and stir gently with a wooden 
        spoon (without piercing dumplings) to make sure they don’t stick to bottom of pot. 
        Boil until dough is tender and meat is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. 
        Remove khinkali with a spider, and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining 
        half of dumplings. Sprinkle khinkali with black pepper, and serve hot.
